  Newsong's Sensory ministry is now open!
</h1>

Our environment, Sensory City, is a space for children with sensory sensitivities to play in a calm room using therapeutic equipment and sensory activities to help regulate their emotions and senses. Our hope is that this environment and our trained volunteers provide an opportunity for parents to relax and know that their child is playing in a safe, calming, loving environment.

Our volunteers have experience in related fields and have been through background checks. Most importantly they have a heart for kids with all sorts of abilities. Currently, our sensory ministry is on Sundays from 10:30-12:30pm. <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/hOhY6hQX5XNROC4M2">Pre-registration</a> is helpful for volunteer staffing.

Please contact <a href="mailto:sensorycity@newsong-fellowship.com?subject=Sensory%20City">sensorycity@newsong-fellowship.com</a> for more information.
