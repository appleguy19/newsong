  One of the greatest compliments we receive is when someone tells us
  that from the very first time they walked through our doors they felt
  welcome and at ease in our "living room". Our greatest hope is that
  each aspect of the service helps create an environment that allows
  people to come as they are and safely explore a faith in Jesus
  regardless of where they are in that journey.

  We invite you to join us in our <em>living room</em> any given Sunday
  at 9:15 or 11:00 a.m. and hope that you too will feel like you belong.
