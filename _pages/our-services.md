One of the greatest compliments we receive is when someone tells us
that from the very first time they walked through our doors they felt
welcome and at ease in our "living room". Our greatest hope is that
each aspect of the service helps create an environment that allows
people to come as they are and safely explore a faith in Jesus
regardless of where they are in that journey.

We invite you to join us in our <em>living room</em> any given Sunday
at 10 AM and hope that you too will feel like you belong.

We also have virtual services available via our Live Stream. Which you can [access here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz9Hqclf7uHKxYAtFPKkzI_tIfmETK13O).
