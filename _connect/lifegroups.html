We believe God created us to live in relationship with one another and that life transformation happens best in small circles of trust and authentic community. As followers of the way of Jesus we are committed to being intentional about this pursuit in our journey as a community of faith.

One of the primary ways we do that at Newsong is through involvement in one of our LifeGroups. LifeGroups are a great place to experience and practice meaningful relationships and an intentional spiritual journey as participants gather on a regular basis to share their stories, their questions, and explore faith and life together.

Groups usually range from 8 to 15 people and generally meet in a host home located throughout the Edwardsville, Glen Carbon, and surrounding areas.

<h3>Interested in you joining a LifeGroup?</h3>

Our groups are open, so you're always welcome to show up!
